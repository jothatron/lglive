What is the LAN-Host boot option?
LAN-Hosting is a highly experimental yet very cool feature that allows other
people in your network to boot completely diskless, provided your network
connection is stable. Effectively, you will only need one instance of lglive
on your whole network which everybody can boot from. How cool is that?
This is the ultimate emergency LAN-Party feature ;).

How does it work?
The process goes as follows: 
1) You boot your live system using the LAN-Host option.
2) Once the lglive desktop shows, you tell people to boot their computers
   but press their boot selection keys just before the BIOS screen goes past.
   Usually, the key is F8 or F12. Once your are in the boot selection screen,
   choose something along the lines of "Network Boot". Every modern BIOS
   supports this. If you can't find this option, look around the BIOS settings
   themselves and see if there's an option to "Enable LAN Boot ROM" or 
   anything like that.
3) You let the diskless clients boot up like this one by one.
4) ???
5) PROFIT!

Possible pitfalls:
- It might fail if a DHCP server is already running on the network.
- You need a fast network and a quick host computer.
- Probably not working for wireless clients.

If something goes wrong, tell me.
