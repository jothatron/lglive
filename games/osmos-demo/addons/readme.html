<h1>Welcome to Osmos</h1>
<i>
Enter the ambient world of Osmos:<br>
Elegant, physics-based gameplay, dreamlike visuals, and a minimalist, electronic soundtrack.<br>
Your objective is to grow by absorbing other motes. Propel yourself by ejecting matter behind you. But be wise: ejecting matter also shrinks you. Relax... good things come to those who wait.<br>
Progress from serenely ambient levels into varied and more challenging worlds. Confront attractors, repulsors and intelligent motes with similar abilities and goals as you.<br>
Good luck on your journey.<br>

<h2>How to play</h2>
Instructions and tips are in-game. The controls should become clear within a minute or two of playing. (Hit [Esc] to exit.)<br>
Initially, most zones (ie. game modes) are locked. Complete open zones to unlock others.<br>
<br><br>


<h2>Suggestions (play a bit first, read later)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Don't feel compelled to play the most difficult zones available. The A* (ambient) zones can be quite relaxing and enjoyable. You can play random versions of any level by hitting [Alt]+[Z].
<li>Time-warping (introduced in later levels) is not always necessary. However, it allows players to dynamically adjust the game to their level of comfort, or challenge, as the case may be.
<li>As the "orbit" levels become more difficult, navigation planning becomes very tricky. (Unlike most games, orbits are held solely via gravitational simulation, which allows for emergent effects.) For those who wish to improve their ability to navigate in these systems, it is worthwhile to read <a href="http://www.braeunig.us/space/orbmech.htm#maneuver">this article section</a> on orbital maneuvers. Happy reading! :)
</ul>
<br>


<h2>Game history/origin (play a bit first, read later)</h2>
The initial idea for the game came from a course I took on spacecraft dynamics, coupled with a Desbrun/Cani paper on deformable modeling using implicit surfaces. [geek.] I thought it'd be fun to control some simulated blobby thing, perhaps in a game. Then one day I realized I could prototype some interesting gameplay with simple circles and mass propulsion. With that prototype in hand, I realized there was deep and elegantly-balanced gameplay to explore here.<br><br>
Along the way I embraced the relaxed/ambient/minimalist nature of the game, and decided to make that a focus. I've been listening to a lot of ambient electronica in the last few years, and wanted to incorporate some music in that vein into the game - procedurally generated if possible. Ideally, I wanted this to become as much a "pleasant multimedia experience" as game. Since then, flOw has come out; comparisons are inevitable...<br><br>
Along the way, I've found a few great collaborators (see below) to work with on the project, as well as some very talented and generous musicians. This game would be a pale shadow without their talent and contributions.<br><br>
